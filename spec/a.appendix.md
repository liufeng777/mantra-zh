# A. Appendix: Prerequisite

These resources will help you understand Mantra very clearly.

## ES2015

ES2015 is the standard version of JavaScript for 2015. It's not fully implemented by all browsers or server-side environments. But, using transpilers like [babel](https://babeljs.io/), we can use E2015 today.

Note: Meteor has built-in support for ES2015

ES2015 is the best thing happen to JavaScript. It introduces a lot of features and fixes a lot of common issues.

## React

React is a UI framework based on JavaScript. Basically, you create the UI inside JavaScript. At first, **it feels weird**. But you'll find it very interesting once you learn the basics.

Just forget about what you already know about HTML for a moment, and learn React. Then rethink. Here are some resources:

* [React Components, Elements, and Instances](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/react-components-elements-and-instances-90800811f8ca)

## React Containers

Now, we rarely use states in React components. Instead, we accept data via props. React's [stateless components](https://medium.com/@joshblack/stateless-components-in-react-0-14-f9798f8b992d) make it very easy.

Then, we compose React containers to fetch data from different sources and load them into UI components. Projects like [react-komposer](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-komposer) make it simple. Check out the following article for more information:

## Meteor Basics

You need to have a better understanding of Meteor. For that, follow Meteor's [official tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/creating-an-app).

Note: Mantra uses some of the above technologies a bit differently. For an example, Meteor's React tutorial suggests using a mixin to access Mongo collection data. But Mantra uses a container, which is the modern way to use React.
