## Overview

Mantra is an application architecture for [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/). With Mantra, we try to achieve two main goals.

**1. High Maintainability**

Maintainability is a key factor for success when working with a large team. We achieve this by **unit testing** every part of our app, while following **standards** for everything. Then it's easy to on-board new users and work with teams.

**2. Future Proof**

JavaScript is a land of **choices**. We have more than one best thing for each problem. It can be hard to tell whatâ€™s the **best solution** now and what will change in the **future**.

*Mantra relies on a set of core principles that will last for a long time. Then, we let others to change as needed.*
